    <h1>Commencement Speech</h1>

    <p>
        Distinguished guests, respected faculty, proud families, and dear fellow graduates,
    </p>

    <p>
        Today marks not just the end of a journey, but the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. 
        We gather here not only to celebrate our academic accomplishments, but to honor the resilience, 
        dreams, and determination that brought us to this moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have faced challenges, both seen and unseen. We’ve worked late into the night, 
        supported each other through difficult times, and kept moving forward even when it wasn’t easy. 
        And now, we stand together as graduates—ready to face the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us remember that education is not the end, but the foundation. It gives us the tools to think critically, 
        lead with compassion, and serve our communities. As we step out into the world, may we carry with us 
        the values we’ve gained here: unity, courage, and a deep sense of purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe in our generation. I believe that we can rebuild what is broken, speak for those without a voice, 
        and shape a brighter future—not just for ourselves, but for our nation and for the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        To our teachers: thank you for your wisdom and guidance. To our families: thank you for your love and sacrifice. 
        And to my fellow graduates: congratulations. This is our time.
    </p>

    <p>
        May we walk forward with pride, with humility, and with the belief that our best days are still ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you.
    </p>
