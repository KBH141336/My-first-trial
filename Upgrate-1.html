    <title>KOBEHTEL - A Message for Sudan</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,</h1>
    
    <p>
        It is my pleasure to be with you on this great dayâ€”a moment we have been waiting for 
        over the years. Today, we come together to discuss the important issues concerning our beloved 
        country and its future.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this moment, what I truly want to say to all the great attendees is this: 
        we must speak clearly and honestly. Let us put all our grievances on the table with pride 
        and respect, and work toward solutions together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Above all, I hope that today marks the beginning of building a new Sudanâ€”a Sudan that 
        can carry all of us forward as one nation, united regardless of race, gender, or background.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you.
    </p>
